Brackets HTML templates extension
===
Brackets extension that will insert a chosen HTML template into the current file. Currently this will overwrite the current content of the file so it should be used on new, empty files. If there is a content a small warning is displayed.

Uses a modal window to display the options as sub-menus are yet to be implemented, which would be the preference. With sub-menus would still be located under the Edit menu since it's altering the current file.

To install this extension:
In Brackets, under "Help" select "Show Extensions Folder". Place extension folder with files inside the "user" folder.
Older versions of Brackets this choice might be under "Debug" or might not exist at all.


Usage
=====
Create a new file. Select "HTML Templates" under the Edit Menu. A modal will appear presenting different HTML template options. Choosing one will insert that HTML into the current file.


Known issues
=====
This will overwrite the contents of the current file if any exists.
